PLEASE REFER TO FinalProjectReadMe.PDF FOR FULL README DOCUMENT. MY PROJECT IS "THE ENGINEER" IF THAT WAS NOT CLEAR :). 

(I put in a lot of effort to make it look nice in LateX and could not get it to show in place of this txt file :). Please take a look there!) 

***Note 1***: It's very difficult to embed videos and gifs into LateX, and the quality gets ruined whenever I tried, so I uploaded the videos to youtube and linked them into the file. Also, the gif is in the repository as well in cas you wanted to see in in gif format. I hope this is not an issue! If github does not allow you to highlight the links, they are here: 

1. 10-second teaser gif: https://youtu.be/j5XhBtfVzho (or look at TeaserGIF.gif in the repository)
2. Final Project Movie(Star Wars Edition): https://youtu.be/GCL6tav1fJI

***NOTE 2***: I am now aware that the recordings of the creatures were not supposed to have the sidebars but these recordings were done over the past 2 weeks before I had known it was a criteria for the movie. I put a lot of effort into including as many recordings as possible, and I just do not have the time to go back and run all the simulations and get the videos without the sidebars. I should have made a better effort to re-record it when I knew, but I was only recently made aware of this. If it is any way possible to excuse this, I would be very thankful. If not, I understand.
