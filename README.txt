PLEASE REFER TO ReadMe_FinalProject.PDF FOR FULL README DOCUMENT. 

(I put in a lot of effort to make it look nice in LateX and could not get it to show in place of this txt file :). Please take a look there!) 

Note: It's very difficult to embed videos into LateX, and the quality gets ruined whenever I tried, so I uploaded the videos to youtube and linked them into the file. I hope this is not an issue! If github does not allow you to highlight the links, they are here:
